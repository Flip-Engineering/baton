# baton

**Cross-harness agent orchestration research.** Can an orchestrator agent running in one full coding harness (Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI) direct *other* full-session harnesses (Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, Z.ai GLM harness) as subordinate workers — with real messaging, telemetry, and mid-flight interruption/steering — rather than the flat "spawn a process, wait for stdout" pattern?

The name: a conductor's baton directs an orchestra; a relay baton gets passed between runners. Both are the point.

## The core question

Every CLI coding agent today can *shell out* to another CLI coding agent. That's not orchestration — it's a blocking subprocess with a string result. Orchestration means:

- **Full-harness workers** — the subordinate keeps its own tools, sandbox, permissions, session state, and context management. You're delegating to *Codex-the-product*, not GPT-the-model.
- **Bidirectional messaging** — workers report progress and ask questions; the orchestrator answers without killing the run.
- **Telemetry** — normalized event stream (turns, tool calls, file edits, tokens, cost) across vendors, observable live.
- **Interruption & steering** — pause, redirect, or cancel a worker mid-turn from the orchestrator or from a human seat.
- **Symmetry** — the same machinery works Claude→(GPT+GLM) and GPT→(Claude+GLM). No privileged vendor.

## Status

Preliminary research, one full review round applied. Recommended architecture: a **non-LLM supervisor hub** with MCP tools northbound (so any orchestrator harness reaches it) and per-harness adapters southbound; the supervisor — not the model — enforces liveness, ordering, and stopping. Grounded in primary-source inspection of the installed CLIs, an external cross-vendor red-team (Codex/GPT-5.x reviewing the design), a 7-lens judge council, and a focused steering/interruption red-team.
